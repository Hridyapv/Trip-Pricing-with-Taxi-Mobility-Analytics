# Trip-Pricing-with-Taxi-Mobility-Analytics
Machine learning project
The dataset from Kaggle
Is a Multi-classification type
Objectice: The main objective is to build a predictive model, which could help them in predicting the surge pricing type pro-actively. This would in turn help them in matching the right cabs with the right customers quickly and efficiently.

Data preprocessing:
Import the libraries
